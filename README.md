# A-Simple-System-to-Detect-High-Blood-Pressure-while-Driving
This was a very complicated yet a robust as well and cost efficient idea that my teammates and I proposed for an Idea-a-thon. 

The problem statemnt was to brainstrom an idea to detect high blood pressure while driving and the solution we came up with was Smartphone-based Non-Contact Blood pressure measurement using Transdermal Optical Imaging Technology while driving.

This was the abstarct that we submitted that got shortlisted upto the final round of the Idea-a-thon:

One-third of the 136 crore population in India suffers from high blood pressure thus making it an important vital parameter that needs to be monitored, especially during driving. Therefore there is a need for user-friendly, low-cost, real-time, as well as a non-contact technique for BP measurement. We propose a smartphone-based blood pressure measurement using the Transdermal optical imaging technique. This technology processes imperceptible facial blood flow changes from videos captured with a smartphone camera and uses advanced machine learning to determine blood pressure from the captured signal.TOI is a recently developed variant of remote photoplethysmography for imaging blood flow patterns from video of the face.TOI separates each video image into multiple layers called bitplanes in each of the 3 color channels. Then, a deep learning-based algorithm can be developed to predict reference systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure from facial blood flow data. Thus the developed BP detection algorithm can be implemented on the Android mobile operating system and a simple holder can be used to keep the phone in the opposite direction of the subject.

If implemented, this is how itll work:
Video Capture : TOI starts by capturing images of the subject using any conventional video camera ( smart phone )

Face Detection and Tracking : TOI automatically detects and tracks your face identifying key regions of interest

Blood Flow Data Extraction : Human skin is translucent. Light and its respective wavelengths are reflected at different layers below the skin and can be used to reveal blood flow information in the human face. This information is captured by and contained in conventional video images.

Signal Processing and Deep Learning: Advanced signal processing and deep learning models are used to predict the blood pressure of the driver.
